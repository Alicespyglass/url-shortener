## User Stories
```
1) As a User
So that I can shorten URLs
I would like a web application that accepts any url
and returns the same shortened version every time
```
```
2) As a User
So that I can use the shortened URL
I would like it to redirect to the original URL
```
```
3) As an interested analytics person
So that I can track usage of each shortened URL
I would like the following information to be stored in a database

- The number of times the page has been visited.
- A unique list of IP addresses that visited the URL.
- One other thing you think might be useful.

For example:

| ID  | Visits | IPs | Something useful |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | 4  | `192.168.0.1` | ? |
| 2  | 7  | `127.0.0.1, 192.168.0.1` | ? |
```
```
4) As an interested analytics person
So that I can view the analytics for each shortened URL
I would like the app the display the stats for each shortened URL

For example: When you visit `localhost:3000/g00g/stats` you see a page with the stats for the that shortened url.

| **Google.com: `goog`**  |
| --- |
| **Visited:** 57  |
| **IP Addresses:** `127.0.0.1, 192.168.0.1` |
| **Something useful:** üò∏ |
```
```
5) As a User
So that I don't create a shortened URL if the input is blank or not a URL
There should be client side validation

For example:

| Input  | Valid |
| --- | --- |
| https://bestcoffee.com | ‚úÖ  |
| google.com | ‚úÖ  |
| twitter .com | ‚ùå |
| google | ‚ùå |
|  | ‚ùå |
| ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| ... | ‚ùå |
```
```
6) As a User
So I can access the app online
The app should be hosted publicly
```
