# URL Shortener
We'd like you to create an app that shortens URLs and should take under two hours. 
Work through the tasks below - don't worry if you don't finish. We're looking to see your understanding and approach to the technical problem. 

**When finished, please send us a link to your app as well as the source code.**

### Tips: 

- We're looking for informative commit messages. 
- Since we're not pairing, we need to know what you're thinking. Think "clear and readable code". 
- Tests are not required but would be a bonus.
- We'd like instructions on how to run your app locally.

# Tasks
## 1
Using a language and/or framework of your choosing, create a web application that accepts any url and returns the same shortened version every time. 

For example: `https://www.pactcoffee.com -> localhost:3000/p4c7`

## 2 
Modify your app to redirect from the shortened url to the original url.

For example: `localhost:3000/g00g` redirects to `https://google.com`

## 3
Modify your app to store, for each url:

- The number of times the page has been visited.
- A unique list of IP addresses that visited the URL.
- One other thing you think might be useful.

For example: Your database might look like: 

| ID  | Visits | IPs | Something useful | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | 4  | `192.168.0.1` | ? |
| 2  | 7  | `127.0.0.1, 192.168.0.1` | ? |

## 4
Modify your app to display the stats for each URL

For example: When you visit `localhost:3000/g00g/stats` you see a page with the stats for the that shortened url.

| **Google.com: `goog`**  | 
| --- |
| **Visited:** 57  |
| **IP Addresses:** `127.0.0.1, 192.168.0.1` |
| **Something useful:** üò∏ |

## 5
Modify your interface to add client side validation that disables the creation of a shortened URL if the input is: 

- Blank
- Not a URL

For example: 

| Input  | Valid |
| --- | --- |
| https://pactcoffee.com | ‚úÖ  |
| google.com | ‚úÖ  |
| twitter .com | ‚ùå |
| google | ‚ùå |
|  | ‚ùå |
| ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| ... | ‚ùå |


## 6
Host your app somewhere* public that we can access. 

For example: `myapp.myhost.com` 

_* Please don't spend any money to do this!_
